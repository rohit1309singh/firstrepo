## Report Embedding

With Report Embedding you can embed scheduled reports in external websites

## Steps

1. Create a report
2. Enable scheduling
3. Enable embedding and take iframe link 
4. Copy in your HTML code

## Pre-requisite:

You should have "embed_report" capability


## Limitations

No drilldown
No workflow action
No field expansion
No table sorting

## Warning

Upgradation will lose the original link. So add the following stanza in server.conf

embedSecret = <your secret string>

## Customization

If you want to change default splunk> stanza in that image, go to web.conf and add this stanza
embed_footer = mydashboard

It should be a string not image

## Configuration changes

Once you embed the report, in savedsearches.conf embed.enabled will become 1


## Sample

<html>
<head>
<title>ABC Bank</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to ABC Bank</h1>
<p>This is a test to check Splunk Embed options</p>
## Your iframe goes here ##
</body>
</html>
